# Taylor Series 

- Any non-polynomial mathematical function can be expressed approximately as a series sum of polynomials. The more terms we add, the closer the resultant equation is to the non-polynomial function.
- For instance, cos(x) can be expressed very accurately in the range -0.5 to 0.5 by the series:
  $$\cos(x)\approx 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{24} $$

- Taylor series' simplest use is approximating the cosine value without a calculator. The expession above is derived from tailor series whose general formula is:

$$\summation_n=0_infinity = an$$

- For example:
Even if we use only the first two terms from the above expression then the value of cos(0.1) can be calculated as follows:

$$\cos(0.1) \approx 1 - \frac{(0.1)^2}{2} = 0.995$$

  Surprisingly the actual value is:

   $$\cos(0.1) = 0.995004165 $$

  This is a nice approach in real life as we didn't need a calculator to find this.

- For the general form of the cosine function:
  $$\cos(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{24} - \cdots$$
