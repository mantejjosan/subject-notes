# Taylor Series 
- Any non-polynomial mathematical function can be expressed approximately as a series sum of polynomials.
- The more the number of terms we add the closer the resultant equation is to the non polynomial function.
- For instance, cos(x) can be expressed very accurately in the range -0.5 to 0.5 by 1-x^2^/2 + x^4^/24

- It's simplest use is approximating cosine value without calculator.
- cos(0.1) â‰ˆ 1-(0.1)^2^/2 = 0.995
- cos(0.1) = 0.995004165

- $E=mc^2$
- $$ cos(x) = 1-x^2/2
- $$
