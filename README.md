# Taylor Series 

- Any non-polynomial mathematical function can be expressed approximately as a series sum of polynomials.
- The more terms we add, the closer the resultant equation is to the non-polynomial function.
- For instance, \(\cos(x)\) can be expressed very accurately in the range \(-0.5\) to \(0.5\) by the series:
  $$
  \cos(x) \approx 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{24}
  $$

- Its simplest use is approximating the cosine value without a calculator.
- For example:
  $$
  \cos(0.1) \approx 1 - \frac{(0.1)^2}{2} = 0.995
  $$
  where the actual value is:
  $$
  \cos(0.1) = 0.995004165
  $$

- For the general form of the cosine function:
  $$
  \cos(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^4}{24} - \cdots
  $$
